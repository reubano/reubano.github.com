### Consulting

I work with small and medium-sized software companies on projects to eliminate inefficiencies or identify how customers are using your products and services. Projects usually involve solving problems with customer engagement, churn, operating expenses, or productivity.

If you have a budget of at least $5k, and would like to hire me to help you make better data driven decisions regarding your operations, customers, or products, please [email me](mailto:rcummings@nerevu.com?subject=Consulting inquiry).

### Speaking/Training

I've [spoken and taught workshops](/podium/) at tech conferences, meetups, and training events in South Africa, Tanzania, the U.S., and Kenya. Some topics I've presented on are [static site generators](/podium/static-sites-generators-ftw-arusha-tanzania/), [data mining](/podium/data-mining-and-processing-for-fun-and-profit-cape-town-south-africa/), and [functional programming](/podium/a-functional-programming-approach-to-data-processing-in-python-boulder-co/).

If you would like me to speak at your event or lead a training session, please [email me](mailto:rcummings@nerevu.com?subject=Speaking inquiry) with:

  - event date(s)
  - desired topic
  - desired format (training, tutorial, workshop, talk, keynote, etc.)

I can usually accommodate non-profit/community events for free, provided that my travel, accommodation, and conference ticket is covered.

I'm also available to train/speak at corporate/for-profit events for a reasonable speaker's fee.
