### Consulting

I work with small and medium-sized software companies on projects to eliminate inefficiencies or identify how customers are using your products and services. Projects usually involve solving problems with customer engagement, churn, operating expenses, or productivity.

If you have a budget of at least $5k, and would like to hire me to help you make better data driven decisions regarding your operations, customers, or products, please [email me](mailto:rcummings@nerevu.com?subject=Consulting%20inquiry).

### Speaking/Training

I've [spoken and taught workshops](/podium/) at events in Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, the U.S., and other locations around the world. Some topics I've presented on are [static site generators](/podium/static-sites-generators-ftw-arusha-tanzania/), [data mining](/podium/data-mining-and-processing-for-fun-and-profit-cape-town-south-africa/), and [functional programming](/podium/a-functional-programming-approach-to-data-processing-in-python-boulder-co/).

If you would like me to speak at your event or lead a training session, please [email me](mailto:rcummings@nerevu.com?subject=Speaking%20inquiry) with:

  - event date(s)
  - desired topic
  - desired format (training, tutorial, workshop, talk, keynote, etc.)

I can usually accommodate non-profit/community events for free, provided that my travel, accommodation, and conference ticket is covered.

I'm also available to train/speak at corporate/for-profit events for a reasonable speaker's fee.
