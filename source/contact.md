## Speaking/Training

I've [spoken](//lanyrd.com/profile/reubano/) at tech conferences and meetups in South Africa, Tanzania, and Kenya. Topics I have presented on include [static site generators](//speakerdeck.com/reubano/static-sites-and-generators-ftw), [data mining](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=05C_E1wyT1I), and [functional programming](//speakerdeck.com/reubano/intro-to-functional-programming).

I can usually accommodate non-profit events for free, provided that my travel (flights and transportation), accommodation (hotel/host), and conference ticket are covered.

I'm also available to train/speak at corporate/for-profit events for a reasonable speaker's fee.
