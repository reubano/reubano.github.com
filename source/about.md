I specialize in [data analysis](/tagged/data/), [visualization](/tagged/visualization/), and [offline first](/tagged/app/) technology.

As an open source enthusiast, my tools of the trade are [Python](/tagged/python/) (Flask), Postgres, SQLite, [JavaScript](/tagged/javascript/)/[CoffeScript](/tagged/coffeescript/) (Mithril.js, Backbone.js, and Node.js), and Bash (Unix shell).

### My Bio

Reuben Cummings is a data scientist and software developer skilled in business development, entrepreneurship, and programming. He is Founder & Managing Director of [Nerevu Development](//nerevu.com) and has worked with clients including the [UN Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](//data.humdata.org), [Moringa School](//moringaschool.com), and [Africaâ€™s Talking](//www.africastalking.com/). Reuben specializes in data integration and analysis, visualization, API development, and workflow automation.

Reuben previously served in IT and Business Development roles at social enterprise [Global Cycle Solutions (GCS)](//www.gcstz.com) in Arusha, Tanzania; and was an analyst at [MIDIOR Consulting](//www.midior.com/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He holds a degree in Chemical Engineering from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](//web.mit.edu/), and is Lead Organizer of the [Arusha Coders](//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arusha-coders) programmers meetup.

### My Life

I first learned to code in BASIC at the age of 13 on a [VTECH Pre-Computer POWER PAD](//www.google.com/search?q=vtech+pre+computer+powerpad). In high school I wrote games for my TI-81 calculator; and by college I had mastered Excel Pivot Tables and dabbled with with Linux shell scripting.

I graduated from [MIT](//web.mit.edu/) in 2005 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. During my time there I worked summer research internships at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](//www.lanl.gov) and [Proctor & Gamble](//www.pg.com) and soon realized R&D wasn't my cup of tea. Not long afterwards I found out about the [MIT E-Club](//web.mit.edu/e-club/) and fell in love with entrepreneurship. Shortly thereafter, I co-founded [Entreprelliance](//web.archive.org/web/20130531011213/http://entreprelliance.com/), an intercollegiate entrepreneurship organization; and [CarboTran Technologies](//www.google.com/search?q=carbotran+technologies), a failed clean-energy startup.

Upon graduating from MIT, I had made my first website in PHP and began creating VBA Excel applications. I went on to found [Pensero Group](//web.archive.org/web/20080328035051/http://www.pensero.com/), a financial reporting and analysis consulting firm; and worked as a business consultant at [MIDIOR Consulting](//www.midior.com/) helping clients develop new-product strategies.

Throughout this time, I developed database (MS Access and SQLite) applications, automated reporting solutions, and business intelligence systems. I also expanded my PHP and BASH scripting abilities.

Having lived in [Cambridge, MA](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts) for ten years, I left the US in 2010 to work for [Global Cycle Solutions](//www.gcstz.com) (GCS) in [Arusha, Tanzania](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arusha). At GCS I worked on various projects including accounting and financial modeling, sales, marketing, strategy, [ERP](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) and reporting systems, employee training, and recruitment.

During this period, I found Python and fell in love with its simplicity and elegance. I soon replaced PHP with it as my language of choice for new script or web development projects. I use Python almost extensively for automating basic tasks, performing data analysis, and creating or integrating with [APIs](/tagged/api/).

I left GCS in late 2012, to pursue freelancing opportunities in web and software development. Since then, I added offline-capable, [responsive](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), web [applications](/tagged/app/) to my skill set.

In 2014, I founded the data analytics firm [Nerevu Development](//nerevu.com).

### My Interests

#### _Finance/Investing_

I started investing at the end of 1999 at the age of 17. Unknown to me at the time, I couldn't have picked a worse period to begin... this was the beginning of the [market collapse of 2000](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). I've learned a lot since then and am convinced about the principles of dollar cost averaging, passive index investing, and asset allocation. I'm also enamored with hedge funds and in the process of developing an application to unlock the secrets of [replicating their returns](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund_replication).

#### _Travel_

I love to travel and have so far been to around 20 countries including 13 in Africa. I occasionally post pictures from my travels [here](/gallery/).
